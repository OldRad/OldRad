- 👋 Hi, I’m @OldRad
- 👀 I’m a retired physician and medical school professor trying to figure out how to fix the numerous bugs in Stellarmate, KStars and EKOS!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... anything I can!!!
- 💞️ I’m looking to stay out of trouble, if possible
- 📫 How to reach me ...  There's bound to be some way on this site.  I'll figure that out later.
